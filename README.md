# 👋 Hi, I am Khalil Hammod

🎓 BA in Politics & Ethics | 💡 Aspiring Data-Informed Policy Analyst  
📊 Python, Statistics, SQL & Machine Learning  
🎯 On a mission to bridge **policy** and **data** for smarter decision-making

## 🛤️ My Journey

I have always been drawn to both **politics** and **technology**. That dual passion led me to earn a degree in **Politics and Ethics from Bard College Berlin**, while always keeping an eye on the tech world.

In 2025, I made a New Year's resolution:  
**Learn how to use data — especially statistical reasoning and machine learning — to support better decisions.**
So I committed myself to studying data skills to become a more informed thinker, analyst, and contributor in the policy space.

## 🧠 What I Focus On

- 📈 **Statistical Inference**  
Confidence intervals, hypothesis testing, and p-values — with growing interest in both **frequentist** and **Bayesian** approaches to uncertainty and inference.

- 🤖 **Supervised Machine Learning**  
  Linear/logistic regression, neural networks, tree-based models, evaluation metrics

- 🧹 **Data Cleaning & Engineering**  
  Preparing raw data for robust analysis

- 📊 **Data Visualization**  
  Turning numbers into narratives

These are the areas that excite me the most and where my projects will live.

## 🚀 Projects I am Building

I am currently working on:

- 📉 Applied statistical inference projects
- 🧠 Supervised ML models for prediction & classification
- 📊 Data exploration notebooks focused on storytelling and insight

As I continue learning, I will be sharing projects that apply **data science techniques to policy problems** and everyday decision-making.

## 🛠️ Tools I Use

- **Languages:** Python, SQL  
- **Libraries:** pandas, matplotlib, seaborn, scikit-learn, statsmodels, NumPy, Tensorflow  
- **Tools:** Jupyter Notebook, Git/GitHub, VS Code
